    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>15g sugar</li>
        <li>40g vegan margarine</li>
        <li>150ml soya (or other non-dairy) milk</li>
        <li>Optional strawberry/raspberry jam and vegan whipping cream, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 200C/gas 6</li>
        <li>Mix the flour and baking powder, and rub in the margarine until no lumps. Then stir in the sugar.</li>
        <li>Add enough of the soya milk to mix to a slightly sticky dough, leaving a little bit of the milk for glazing.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured board (to about 1.5cm thick), then cut out the scones with a 2 1/2" cutter.  Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and brush the tops with the left-over milk.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 15 minutes, until risen and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Serve with jam and cream, if desired. And enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
